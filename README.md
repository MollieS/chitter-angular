# chitter-angular

Attempting to remake the Chitter Challenge with Angular.

Steps:

1. Use Angular to set up a homepage where a user can send and view peeps.
2. Create an API in node to receive post requests containing the peep, and allow get requests which display the peeps.
3. Set up a database using mongodb to store peeps.
4. Once the database is connected to the API, I should be able to add sign up, log in and log out features to the Angular page.
